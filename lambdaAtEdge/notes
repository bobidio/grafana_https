Components:
Grafana instance
    Represented in my example with EC2 instance
HTTPS access to Grafana instance
    Defines domain and URL used for Cognito Client Sign-in & Sign-out URLs
Cognito User Pool for authentication
S3 Image bucket
    pre-existing
CloudFront & Lambda@Edge to guard access to S3 Image bucket referencing Cognito User Pool
    'Artifact bucket' & 'Target bucket' required for deployment


Actions:
Cloudformation template to create Cognito user pool
  Perhaps steal from AWS LambdaAtEdge solution?
  Push reference into SSM Parameter store
    where? region: 'ap-southeast-2'
  Definition requires 'sign-in' and 'sign-out' URLs from the associated application
  Existing Grafana Cognito client:
    https://ap-southeast-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cognito/users/?region=ap-southeast-2#/pool/ap-southeast-2_KbwqC6jz0/app-integration-app-settings?_k=kjlbza
    Sign in and sign out URLs
        Callback URL(s): https://grafana.mrsandbox.rocks, https://grafana.mrsandbox.rocks/login/generic_oauth
        Sign out URL(s): https://grafana.mrsandbox.rocks

SSM Parameter store
  Containing Cognito user pool reference from other template
    where? region: 'ap-southeast-2'

'Artifact bucket' & 'Target bucket'
  Target need not be us-east-1, but tamplate must be deployed there
  Artifact bucket - not sure.  Any reason it can't be us-east-1?
